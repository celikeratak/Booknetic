"1. Live sync;<br/>If you have a few staff, this method would be more "
"convenient for you. When your customers are booking, the plugin will connect "
"to the google calendar and sync busy slots in real-time.<br/>2. Background "
"sync;<br/>For this method, first, you must configure the Cron jobs ( <a "
"href='https://www.booknetic.com/documentation/cron-job' target='_blank'>How "
"to?</a> ). The shorter you set the Cron jobs interval, the more accuracy you "
"will get. This method is usually designed for businesses with a large number "
"of employees and using the \"Any Staff\" option. Because in this case, when "
"your customer selects Any staff option, it might take more than 30-60 "
"seconds to sync all Staff busy slots with Google calendar. By choosing this "
"method, the plugin Cron Jobs will connect to the Google Calendars in the "
"background at the interval you set up and will store the busy slots of all "
"your employees in your local databases. During booking, it will read the "
"information directly from your database. Errors in this method are "
"inevitable. For example, if you configure your cron jobs to run every 15 "
"minutes, the busy slot you add to your Google calendar will be stored in the "
"plugin's local database every 15 minutes. That is, within these 15 minutes, "
"someone can book an appointment in that time slot. Therefore, the shorter "
"you configure the Cron jobs, the less likely there will be errors."
